These are the solutions that I have submitted for [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com)

2018 is the first year I'm actually following the releases. Most of the submissions for previous years are my own solution and I will try to add attribution for those which are not.

All my solutions will be written in python. I'm not very good at python, but hopefully enough of these puzzles will help me get better :D
