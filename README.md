These are the solutions that I have submitted for [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com)

2018 is the first year I'm actually following the releases. Most of the submissions for previous years are my own solution. I will try to add attribution for solutions which are not my own, but I'm not perfect.

All my solutions will be written in python. I'm not very good at python, but hopefully enough of these puzzles will help me get better :D
